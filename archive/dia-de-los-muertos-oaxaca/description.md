## Description

The Day of the Dead (Día de los Muertos) is a Mexican tradition where families welcome back the souls of deceased relatives. In Oaxaca, the celebration includes building elaborate altars (ofrendas) decorated with marigold flowers, candles, photographs, and favorite foods of the departed. This photograph captures a family altar in a rural home, showing the blend of indigenous and Catholic elements.

## Cultural Significance

The altar is a central element of the Day of the Dead, representing the temporary return of the spirits. Marigold flowers (cempasúchil) are believed to guide the souls with their vibrant color and scent. The offering includes pan de muerto, sugar skulls, and personal mementos. This ritual reinforces family bonds and cultural continuity.

## Personal Observations

The family allowed me to photograph the altar during the evening of November 2nd. The atmosphere was respectful and contemplative. The use of natural light from candles added a warm, intimate quality to the image.
