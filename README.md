# Archivo Ritual Mexicano

*A collaborative digital archive of Mexican rituals, inspired by the photographic philosophy of Graciela Iturbide.*

## Manifesto

This archive seeks to document and preserve the diverse cultural rituals of Mexico, focusing on the relationships between the individual and the cultural, the real and the psychological, and humanity and nature. We believe that rituals are living expressions of collective memory and identity, deserving of careful observation and respectful documentation.

## Submission Guidelines

We welcome contributions from photographers, anthropologists, and community members. Each submission should include:

1. **A high-quality photograph** (JPEG or PNG) that respectfully represents the ritual.
2. **Title** of the ritual.
3. **Location** (State, Town).
4. **Date of documentation** (approximate date when the photograph was taken).
5. **Short descriptive text** (300–500 words) explaining the ritual's significance, its cultural context, and any personal observations.

Please structure your submission as a new folder within the `archive/` directory, containing the image file and a Markdown file with the descriptive text and metadata.

We aim to create a living resource that inspires future generations of documentarians.
